# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug related to specificity. A more specific selector unintentionally overrides a more general selector, leading to unexpected styling results. The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.

**Problem:** Incorrect styling due to specificity issues.

**Solution:** Adjusting selector specificity to ensure the desired styling is applied correctly.
